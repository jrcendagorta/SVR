# Least Squares Support Vector Regression for Peptides

This project was part of a larger collaborative effort in using machine learning models
to determine the most efficient and accurate method in predciting the free energy surfaces
of a variety of oligopeptides. 

Currently, the LS-SVR method is broken into two different code structures.
